# IR-Sensor
Using an Infrared remote control (TV remote should work) as an indicator to the blink rate of an LED by directing the IR beam to the IR receiver (1838).
Control the delay between blinking using the numbers on the remote control. For example, by pressing ‘1’ the blink rate will be 100ms, by pressing ‘9’ it will be 900ms.
